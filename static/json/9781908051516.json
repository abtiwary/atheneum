    "description": "The story of one obsessive fan’s unlikely ambition: to bowl just one ball at his childhood hero, Sachin Tendulkar. From the very first time he’d ever watched the \"Little Master\" bat, as a 12-year-old boy, Adam Carroll-Smith had been transfixed. He dreamed not just of bowling to Tendulkar, but of actually knocking over his off stump. Just one problem: he was never really much of a cricketer. However, determined not to let such a small detail stand in his way—and eager to settle an old score with a childhood chum—Carroll-Smith earnestly set about achieving the unthinkable during India’s 2011 tour of England. A hilarious summer ensued as he attempted to live out his fantasy, fending off the attentions of over-zealous fellow fans, crazed Italian spiritualists and his meddling best friend—not to mention the dozens of blazered officials and luminous-jacketed stewards standing between him and his hero.",
