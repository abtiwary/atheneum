    "description": "Praise for the previous edition: \"An amazing array of shapes and textures that would be the envy of Joan Miro.\" -- The Wall Street Journal \"Hundreds of extremely magnified images such as botanicals, minerals and insects, transport the reader into another world. . . . Who knew morning glory could look so interesting!\" -- Chicago Sun-Times Microcosmos is a remarkable photo-journey into everyday life through spectacular microscopic images. This new edition lifts the book to breathtaking realms. The extraordinary images, produced with the latest microphotography technologies, are displayed on more reader-friendly larger page layouts. Most of the 205 full-color photographs were taken using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which allows us to see our world as never before. Each page features a single image, a remarkable close-up that reveals form, shape and color in incredible detail. The book is divided into six chapters that cover: Microorganisms Botany The human body Zoology Minerals Technology Every photograph is accompanied by an informative caption that describes the image, how it was captured and the number of magnifications. With the stunning production values of its full-color photographs and its clearly written text, Microcosmos provides a fascinating journey of discovery for every reader.",
