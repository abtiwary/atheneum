That means less time wasted sorting out conflicting terms and symbols and more time spent modeling better software systems. Now this powerful book/CD package arms you with everything you need to make the most of UML and the rapidly growing suite of UML-based products. The authors walk you through the entire language, providing easy-to-follow guidelines and loads of real-world examples. They also give you detailed explanations of all UML diagrams, a full-length case study showing how UML is used to develop an application, a visual glossary of all UML notations, and step-by-step instructions on how to: * Move to UML from Booch, OMT, and Objectory * Map Java to UML-including many full-blown examples * Define design patterns and how to use patterns in UML * Describe real-time systems in UML * Employ use cases to capture a system's functional requirements On the CD-ROM you'll find: * All UML models from the book * All the Java code from the book * Demo version of Rational Rose(r) 4.0",
